# PlotTwist 🌱 — Hack the 6ix 2026

**Helping plants and people grow.** Scan your backyard, tell us what you dream of
growing, and PlotTwist computes the optimal planting layout — space, sunlight,
watering logistics, and carbon footprint included. PlotTwist helps plants and people grow.

### Key Features

* **Smart Camera Yard Scanning** — Easily measure awkwardly shaped backyard garden beds just by taking a photo with your phone next to a common object (like a coin).
* **Smart Garden Layouts** — An intelligent, built-in planner that instantly figures out the best spot for each plant by balancing sunlight, watering needs, spacing, and which plants grow well together.
* **Track Your Environmental Impact** — See exactly how much carbon you are saving by growing your own food, backed by real environmental data.

## Quickstart

**Test website** (scan UI + optimizer)

```bash
cd app && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open the Vite URL (usually http://localhost:5173). On **Scan**:
1. Choose **Coin (recommended)** or **Custom object**
2. Upload a yard photo
3. Tap both edges of the reference; a bed outline is pre-placed — drag its corners to fit (tap to add corners for odd shapes)
4. **Measure yard →** (or skip to the demo yard)

**Optimizer**

```bash
cd optimizer && npm install && npm test && npm run demo
```

**Yard scan** (library only)

```bash
cd yard-scan && npm install && npm test && npm run demo
```

**Catalog + API**

```bash
cd database && pip install -r requirements.txt && python seed.py
cd ../backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Data contracts: `optimizer/src/types.ts`
- Curated source of truth: `database/plants_curated.json` (seed into Mongo; app reads via backend)

**Carbon honesty:** food plants only — `yieldKgPerSeason × co2eSavedPerKg` (Poore & Nemecek / OWID). Ornamentals get no invented CO₂e; their impact case is pollinator/biodiversity.

## Toronto Food Waste Context

Source: [City of Toronto — Food Waste](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/recycling-organics-garbage/waste-management/waste-reduction/food-waste/) (2017–2018 single-family household audits).

| Stat | Value |
|---|---|
| City-wide food waste generated annually | **99,000+ tonnes** (avoidable + unavoidable) |
| Average single-family household food waste | **200+ kg / year** |
| Avoidable food waste | **100+ kg / year** (>50% of total) |
| Most wasted edible category | **Fruits & vegetables — ~45 kg / household / year** |
| Put in the Green Bin | **~80%** of food waste |
| Canadian household edible waste (same page, national) | **$1,300+ / year** thrown away |

PlotTwist connects home-grown food to these numbers in the backend (`backend/food_waste_stats.py`):

```
% fruit/veg waste offset   = foodKgPerSeason ÷ 45 × 100
% avoidable waste offset   = foodKgPerSeason ÷ 100 × 100
% total food waste offset  = foodKgPerSeason ÷ 200 × 100
Green Bin diversion (est.) = foodKgPerSeason × 0.80
$ edible waste avoided (est.) = (foodKgPerSeason ÷ 100) × $1,300 CAD
```

`foodKgPerSeason` comes from the optimizer (`yieldKgPerSeason × plant count`). One season is treated as one year for the comparison.

**API**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/stats/toronto-food-waste
curl "http://localhost:8000/impact/food-waste?foodKg=22.5"
```

Example: a garden yielding **22.5 kg** food/season offsets **50%** of the typical Toronto household’s annual fruit & veg waste, **22.5%** of avoidable waste, and keeps an estimated **18 kg** out of the Green Bin.

## 🎮 XP system

Water, harvest, and keep carbon savings climbing — earn XP and level up!
Implemented in `app/src/xp.ts` (the rules below) and `App.tsx` (the
earning/losing/streak engine, a corner XP badge, and level-up/streak popups).
Local to your device — no accounts, no backend.

### Earning XP

- 💧 **Water a due plant** — +2 XP each
- 🤏 **Harvest a ready plant** — +5 XP
- 🌱 **Reseed an empty spot** — +3 XP
- 🌍 **Carbon milestone** — every 5 kg CO₂e your garden saves → +20 XP
- 🔥 **Streaks** — see below

### Losing XP

- Miss a scheduled watering → **−4 XP** per plant
- Leave a ready plant unharvested 7+ days → **−2 XP**, repeats weekly until picked
- XP never drops below your current level's floor — losses slow your next level, never demote you

### Streaks 🔥

Confirm every watering due each day and your streak climbs; miss one day and it resets to 0.

| Streak | Bonus |
|---|---|
| 3 days | +10 XP |
| 7 days | +25 XP |
| 30 days | +150 XP |

### Levels

| Level | Title | XP needed |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🌱 Seedling | 0 |
| 2 | 🪴 Dirt Enthusiast | 150 |
| 3 | 🌻 Master Grower | 400 |
| 4 | 👑 Legendary Gardener | 800 |

## 🏆 Friends & leaderboard

Optional, opt-in layer on top of the local XP system: log in, pick a
username, add friends by username, and see who's ahead. Nothing else in
the app needs an account — XP/streaks keep working fully offline either
way, and the Profile tab just shows a "not configured" message if Auth0
isn't set up.

**Setup** (both env files are gitignored — copy the `.env.example`s):

1. In the [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com), create:
   - A **Single Page Application** — Allowed Callback/Logout/Web Origins:
     `http://localhost:5173`. Copy its **Domain** and **Client ID**.
   - An **API** (Applications → APIs → Create API) — any name, and copy its
     **Identifier** (a URL-shaped string, e.g. `https://plottwist-api`).
2. Repo root `.env`: set `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` (the API
   Identifier from step 1).
3. `app/.env.local`: set `VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, and
   `VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE` (must match `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` above).
4. Restart both the backend and `npm run dev`.

**Backend** (`backend/auth.py`, `backend/main.py`): verifies the Auth0
access token (JWKS/RS256) on every call, then stores one small profile
doc per user — `{ username, xp, streakDays, friends[] }` — in Mongo, or
in memory when `MONGODB_URI` isn't set (same demo-safe fallback as
everything else in this API).

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /users/me` | Fetch (or lazily create) your profile |
| `PUT /users/me/username` | Claim a unique username |
| `PUT /users/me/stats` | Push local `xp`/`streakDays` up |
| `POST /friends/add` | Add a friend by username (bidirectional) |
| `GET /friends` | List your friends' profiles |
| `GET /leaderboard` | You + friends, ranked by XP |

**Frontend** (`app/src/components/LeaderboardPanel.tsx`, wired into the
Profile tab): `@auth0/auth0-react`'s `Auth0Provider` only mounts when
`VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN`/`VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` are set (`app/src/lib/auth0Config.ts`).
Logged-in users sync their live `xp`/`streakDays` from `app/src/xp.ts`
to the backend automatically so friends see current standing.

## Pitch — what to say

Use this as a script outline (≈2–3 min). Swap in live numbers from your demo layout.

### 1. Hook (problem — local + relatable)

> “Toronto single-family homes throw away **over 200 kg of food every year** — more than **100 kg is avoidable**, and **fruits and vegetables are the #1 wasted food** at about **45 kg per household**. Almost **80%** of that still goes in the Green Bin. Canadians waste **$1,300+** of edible food at home annually. People want to grow their own food, but most don’t know *what* fits *their* yard, sun, or skill level — so good intentions turn into wasted space and wasted groceries.”

### 2. Solution (what PlotTwist does)

> “**PlotTwist** scans your yard, learns what you want to grow, and computes an **optimized planting layout** — space, sunlight, watering, companions, and **carbon impact**. When your dream garden doesn’t fit, we **negotiate** — that’s the plot twist: we trade plants, shrink beds, and show greener swaps instead of saying no.”

### 3. Demo beat (show, don’t tell)

Walk through: **Scan → Preferences → Select → Results → Dashboard**

Call out one concrete win from the results screen, e.g.:

> “This **demo backyard** grows **~X kg of food per season**, offsets **Y%** of the average Toronto household’s **fruit & veg waste**, and saves **~Z kg CO₂e** — food plants only, no greenwashing on flowers.”

(Pull X/Y/Z from the app’s **kg food grown**, `/impact/food-waste?foodKg=X`, and **kg CO₂e saved** stats.)

### 4. Why it’s credible

- **Yard scan:** coin or reference object + phone camera → real grid (`yard-scan/`)
- **Optimizer:** on-device TypeScript engine, tested (`optimizer/`)
- **Plants & weather:** curated catalog verified vs OpenPlantDB + Perenual, live Open-Meteo, PlantNet ID (`backend/`, `database/`)
- **Honest carbon:** only food yield × published lifecycle factors; ornamentals = pollinator story, not fake CO₂e
- **Toronto math:** comparisons backed by City audit data, not vibes (`/impact/food-waste`)

### 5. Close (impact + vision)

> “We’re not just a garden planner — we’re helping **Toronto households grow food that would otherwise be wasted**, with numbers tied to **City waste audits**. PlotTwist turns a backyard photo into a **measurable** step toward less Green Bin waste, lower grocery bills, and lower food-mile emissions. **Helping plants and people grow.**”

### Sound bites (one-liners if judges ask)

- **Problem:** “The average Toronto home wastes **45 kg of produce a year** — we help you grow that instead.”
- **Differentiator:** “When your garden doesn’t fit, we **negotiate**, not reject.”
- **Impact:** “Every kg you grow is a kg that never hit the **Green Bin**.”
- **Honesty:** “We only claim CO₂e on **food you actually yield** — no invented numbers for petunias.”

### What not to claim

- Don’t say PlotTwist eliminates all household food waste — compare to **baselines** (45 / 100 / 200 kg).
- Don’t conflate **CO₂e from growing vs buying** with **methane from landfill** unless you add a separate model.
- The **$1,300** figure is **Canadian national** context on Toronto’s page, not a Toronto-only audit — say “estimated” or “roughly.”
